## Install PostrgesSQL

Install Postgres as a container may be tricky sometimes, mostly because you will need the PgAdmim alongside to interact with it. So here we are with two possibilities: 

* [kubegres] Docker + Kubernetes + Traefik
* [helm] Docker + Helm Chart + Kubernetes + Traefik

Note: Rancher Desktop provides a suite for both scenarios.
